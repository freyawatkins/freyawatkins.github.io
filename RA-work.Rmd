* I am currently the primary research assistant for the [Online Reading Research Project](http://www.ssc.education.ed.ac.uk/research/onlinereading/) about web-based reading strategies in deaf and hearing teenagers. I have collected and coded eyetracking, 'think aloud' and language assessment data for the project in a number of locations including Edinburgh, London, Brighton and Birmingham. The project is a collaboration between the University of Edinburgh, University of Roehampton & University of Birmingham and is funded by the British Academy, ESRC and Leverhulme Trust. 

* Since spring 2017 I have been a research assistant in Dr Robin Thompson's M2L2 lab. This has mainly involved data collection and coding for a variety of sign language processing and production studies, including behavioural, eyetracking and electromyography methodologies.
