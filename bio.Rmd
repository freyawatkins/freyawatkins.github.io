I previously studied German & Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, where I developed an interest in British Sign Language (BSL) and sign language linguistics, taking my first BSL course at [Deaf Action](http://www.deafaction.org.uk/). 

In my second year I helped run SignSoc, the student BSL society at Edinburgh. In the summer I undertook a research internship at the [Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dcal) at UCL with Dr Robin Thompson.

While on my Erasmus year I worked as a language assistant and took my first module in psycholinguistics at Eberhard-Karls-Universitaet Tuebingen. I also took courses in German Sign Language (DGS) in Hamburg & Tuebingen. 

On my return to Scotland I wrote my MA dissertation on auditory attention and visuospatial cognition in bimodal bilinguals, supervised by [Prof Antonella Sorace](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/antonella-sorace) and [Dr Thomas Bak](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/thomas-bak).

After graduating I returned to Germany, where I continued to learn DGS while working as a German translator and English tutor, before receiving 1+3 ESRC funding for a MSc and PhD with Dr Robin Thompson, now at the University of Birmingham.
