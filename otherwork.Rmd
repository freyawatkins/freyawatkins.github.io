* Since 2013 I have worked as a self-employed German-English translator and proofreader. I have experience translating a range of texts, varying from academic studies to technical datasheets to children's fiction. I proofread academic essays written in English, particularly those written by German native speakers.

* I also have 10 years' experience working as an audio transcriber. I have worked for [Take Note Typing](https://www.takenotetyping.com/), [Amara (Universal Subtitles)](https://amara.org/en/) and a range of individual clients including academics and businesses.

* If you need any transcription, translation or proofreading work done, feel free to contact me!<br/>
